# Django-React-ShoppingList
Integrating Django, React and Redux to create a CRUD Single Page Application(SPA).

Since Christmas is soon I decided to make a Shopping List app to practice my Full-Stack Development skills.
I focused on making the app simple but also touch on all the recent things ive learned such as integrating
the React/Redux front end with the Django back end. For this project Django only took care of the models and
React took care of everything else as it is a simple app. As for the CSS Framework I used Semantic-UI-React.

API Used: Django Rest Framework
API Tool: Fetch

Functionality:
<b>Some CRUD operations such as:
  *<i>Create (complete and instantaneous due to redux integration)</i>
  *<i>Refresh (dynamic SPA)<i> 
  *<i>Update (TODO)</i>
  *<i>Delete (complete)</i></b>
