# Django-React-ShoppingList
Integrating Django, React and Redux to create a CRUD Single Page Application(SPA).

Since Christmas is soon I decided to make a Shopping List app to practice my Full-Stack Development skills.</br>
I focused on making the app simple but also touch on all the recent things ive learned such as integrating</br>
the React/Redux front end with the Django back end. For this project Django only took care of the models and</br>
React took care of everything else as it is a simple app. As for the CSS Framework I used Semantic-UI-React.

API Used: <i>Django Rest Framework</i></br>
API Tool: <i>Fetch</i>

Functionality:
</br>
<b>Some CRUD operations such as:
 </br>
  *<i>Create (complete and instantaneous due to redux integration)</i>
  </br>
  *<i>Refresh (dynamic SPA)<i> 
 </br>
  *<i>Update (TODO)</i>
 </br>
  *<i>Delete (complete)</i></b>
